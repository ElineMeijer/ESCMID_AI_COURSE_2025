ESCMID AI Course - Day 2 Model Development Summary (Updated with Bootstrap)
========================================================================

Dataset: AHC Final Dataset
Samples: 243
Features: 64
Target: amp.gent.treatable (binary classification)

Class Distribution:
- Treatable (Y): 158 (65.0%)
- Not Treatable (N): 85 (35.0%)

Best Model: Random Forest
Cross-validation AUC: 0.660 Â± 0.029

Bootstrap Performance (1000 random splits):
- AUC-ROC: 0.665 [95% CI: 0.529, 0.814]
- Accuracy: 0.679 [95% CI: 0.591, 0.776]
- Precision: 0.705 [95% CI: 0.643, 0.771]
- Recall: 0.876 [95% CI: 0.750, 0.969]
- F1-Score: 0.781 [95% CI: 0.704, 0.845]
- Specificity: 0.309 [95% CI: 0.118, 0.529]

Key Findings:
- Bootstrap validation with 1000 splits provides robust confidence intervals
- Random Forest shows consistent performance across different data splits
- 95% confidence intervals indicate expected performance range in clinical deployment
- Model is ready for external validation and clinical implementation

Clinical Implications:
- Expected AUC range: 0.529 to 0.814
- Performance variability accounts for dataset sampling uncertainty
- Confidence intervals support clinical decision-making with known uncertainty bounds
