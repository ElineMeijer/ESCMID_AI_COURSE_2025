Feature Engineering:
- Categorical encoding: One-hot encoding for 7 categorical features
- Numerical scaling: StandardScaler for 1 numerical features
- Missing value handling: Imputation with 'Unknown' category

Machine Learning Approaches:
1. Single-Target Learning: Individual models for each resistance gene
2. Multi-Target Learning: One model predicting multiple genes simultaneously

Models Evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- SVM
- Naive Bayes


Single-Target Results:
- CTXM1: Best model = Gradient Boosting (AUC = 0.777 ± 0.019)
- TEM: Best model = Gradient Boosting (AUC = 0.730 ± 0.028)
- SHV: Best model = Gradient Boosting (AUC = 0.734 ± 0.020)


Multi-Target Results:
- Logistic Regression: Average AUC = 0.708 ± 0.021
- Random Forest: Average AUC = 0.639 ± 0.021
- Gradient Boosting: Average AUC = 0.756 ± 0.009
- SVM: Average AUC = 0.710 ± 0.017
- Naive Bayes: Average AUC = 0.551 ± 0.007


Key Findings:
- Cross-validation provides robust performance estimates for rare events
- Different resistance genes show varying predictability
- Species and clinical source are often important predictive features
- Multi-target learning can capture gene correlations

Clinical Implications:
- Models can assist in rapid resistance gene screening
- Predictions should complement, not replace, molecular testing
- Performance varies by gene prevalence and biological factors
- Continuous validation needed for clinical deployment

Next Steps:
- Validate on external datasets from different institutions
- Incorporate additional clinical variables (antimicrobial use, etc.)
- Develop clinical decision support integration
- Monitor performance drift over time
