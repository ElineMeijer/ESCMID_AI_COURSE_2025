# MALDI-TOF Machine Learning Workshop - Jupyter Notebook

Welcome to the GitHub repository containing the Jupyter notebook for the **ESCMID AI and Machine Learning in Medical Microbiology Diagnostics Workshop 2025**.

---

## About the Notebook

This notebook guides you through advanced data analysis techniques applied to **MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry** data for microbial species classification. It covers:

- Data preprocessing of MALDI-TOF spectra  
- Dimensionality reduction methods: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and PLS-DA  
- Machine learning model training and evaluation, including Logistic Regression and XGBoost  
- Model interpretability and biomarker discovery using feature importance and SHAP values  
- Interactive 3D visualizations for exploring spectral data and embeddings  

The notebook is designed to provide hands-on experience applying machine learning workflows to real clinical microbiology data.

## Two Versions Available

- **Student Version:** Contains instructional cells with empty code blocks or questions for you to complete. This version is intended for practice during the workshop.  
- **Normal (Solution) Version:** Contains complete code solutions and explanations for all exercises and analysis steps.

Make sure you are working on the **correct version** for your needs.

## Important: Data Download Instructions

The notebook relies on the **DRIAMS B MALDI-TOF dataset**, which is approximately **3GB** in size.

Please carefully read the **data README file** _before_ the workshop session (Wednesday at 14:00) to:

- Understand the data structure and format  
- Download the dataset in advance to avoid delays during the practical session

The data is not included in this repository due to its size but can be downloaded from the official repository linked in the data README.

## Getting Started

1. Download this repository.  
2. Upload the notebook to Google Drive and use Google Colab! 
3. Download and place the DRIAMS B dataset in the expected directory as described in the data README.  
4. Open the Jupyter notebook and begin your analysis!
